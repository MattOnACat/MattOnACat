# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rose Awen Brindle [@RosesHaveThorns]

Im currently studying Space Science and Robotics at Aberystwyth University! I mostly work with C, Java and Python, plus a bit of HTML/CSS/Django when I feel up to doing some web dev.

I was formerly called Matthew Brindle, just to avoid any confusion!
